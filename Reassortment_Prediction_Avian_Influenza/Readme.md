## Background and Objective
Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a persistent global threat due to its ability to evolve
rapidly through reassortment. This project presents a computational framework that inte-
grates DNABERT-2, a transformer-based foundation model for genomic sequences,
with machine learning and genetic algorithms to predict reassortment events.
